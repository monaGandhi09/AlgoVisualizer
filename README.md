### ALGO VISUALIZER
# Sorting Viusalizer
This project mainly consists of two profiles Sorting Visualizer and Pathfinding Visualizer.Sorting Visualizer makes it easy for us to understand the working of different sorting methods.
# PathFinding Visualizer
Pathfinding Visualizer is a useful efficient way to understand pathfinding problems using Mathematical Algorithms such as Dijkstra Algorithm, BFS Algorithm and DFS Algorithm.
